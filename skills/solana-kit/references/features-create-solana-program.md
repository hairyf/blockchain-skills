# Create Solana program (Kit)

The create-solana-program installer scaffolds a program repo and can generate a JavaScript client compatible with Kit. Run: pnpm create solana-program (or npm create solana-program). Follow prompts to pick framework (e.g. Anchor), then select the JS client to get a generated library like the @solana-program/* packages — getXxxInstruction, fetchXxx, decodeXxx, PDA helpers. The client is generated by Codama from the program IDL. Use it with Kit for instructions, accounts, and transactions. Repo: github.com/solana-program/create-solana-program.

## Key points

- Use when starting a new program and you want a Kit-compatible JS client. Generated code follows the same patterns as @solana-program/system, @solana-program/token, etc.
