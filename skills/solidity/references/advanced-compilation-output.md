# Analysing Compilation Output

Use compiler output to inspect generated bytecode and assembly. Helpful for debugging, gas tuning, and comparing codegen before/after changes.

## Bytecode and assembly

- **`solc --bin contract.sol`**: Raw bytecode (hex). Hard to read; use for hashes or deployment.
- **`solc --asm contract.sol`**: Human-readable EVM assembly. Comments reference source locations (e.g. `"contract.sol":17:84`). Use `--asm` to understand what the compiler generated.

The assembly output starts with creation/constructor code. The main contract runtime is in a sub-object (e.g. `sub_0`). The `auxdata` field is the metadata hash (see ABI/metadata docs).

## Optimized vs non-optimized

- **`solc --optimize --asm contract.sol`**: Optimized assembly. Use to compare gas or to check if two Solidity variants produce the same optimized code (e.g. diff after stripping source comments).
- Optimizer runs only when `--optimize` (or equivalent in Standard JSON) is set; optimizer settings (runs, etc.) affect output.

## Combined JSON and generated sources

- **`solc --combined-json generated-sources,generated-sources-runtime contract.sol`**: Includes internal generated files (e.g. `#utility.yul`) used in the assembly. Useful to map assembly helpers back to generated Yul.

## Notes

- `--asm` output is not guaranteed machine-readable and may change between minor compiler versions.
- For reproducible builds, rely on Standard JSON and documented output selection fields rather than parsing `--asm` programmatically.
