Uniswap v4 is an AMM with a singleton PoolManager: all pool state lives in one contract. Interactions go through `unlock` → `unlockCallback`, where callers perform swaps, liquidity changes, and donations, then settle balance deltas before the callback returns. Pools can attach hooks for lifecycle callbacks (initialize, add/remove liquidity, swap, donate).
