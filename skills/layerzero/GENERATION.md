Documentation was derived from the LayerZero repository (https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero). The repo contains smart contracts and no dedicated `docs/` tree; official developer docs are at https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/. Content was synthesized from:

- `contracts/` — Endpoint.sol, interfaces (ILayerZeroEndpoint, ILayerZeroReceiver, ILayerZeroUserApplicationConfig, ILayerZeroMessagingLibrary, ILayerZeroOracle, ILayerZeroRelayer), mocks (PingPong.sol, OmniCounter.sol)
- `README.md` — overview, development, deployment
- `constants/config.json` — default config and relayer/oracle references
