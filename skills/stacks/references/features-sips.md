# Stacks Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

SIPs describe Stacks blockchain implementation and propose improvements. They are the primary medium for new features, community input on system-wide issues, and design decisions.

- **Process:** Defined in [SIP 000](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-000/sip-000-stacks-improvement-proposal-process.md).
- **Repository:** [stacksgov/sips](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips) under the Stacks Community Governance org.

When implementing or reviewing consensus, PoX, or contract behavior, check the relevant SIP in that repo for the canonical spec (e.g. SIP-007 for stacking consensus and STX operations on Bitcoin).
