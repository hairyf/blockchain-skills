# Anchor IDL (Interface Description Language)

JSON description of the program: instructions, accounts, types. Generated by `anchor build` at `target/idl/<program-name>.json`. Used by clients to build and decode instructions and accounts.

## IDL layout

- **address** — Program ID
- **metadata** — name, version, description
- **instructions** — name, discriminator (8 bytes), accounts (name, writable, signer, address, pda seeds), args
- **accounts** — name, discriminator
- **types** — struct definitions for account/instruction data

## Discriminators

- **Instruction**: first 8 bytes of `sha256("global:<instruction_name>")`.
- **Account**: first 8 bytes of `sha256("account:<AccountName>")`.

Clients send the instruction discriminator as the first 8 bytes of instruction data; Anchor does this automatically. Same account discriminator is written when creating accounts and checked when deserializing.

## Client usage (TypeScript)

- **Call instruction**: `program.methods.<camelCaseInstruction>(...args).accounts({...}).rpc()` or `.instruction()`.
- **Fetch account**: `program.account.<accountName>.fetch(pubkey)`.
- **PDA resolution**: If the IDL defines `pda.seeds` for an account, the client can resolve the address from seeds (e.g. from other accounts in the same instruction).
