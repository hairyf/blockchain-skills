# Bonfire Session Bootstrap Rule

All AI agent work in this repository must start with `/bonfire start` before any other action.

## Required Behavior

- Treat `/bonfire start` as a hard prerequisite for every new session.
- Do not begin coding, planning, editing, or execution before session bootstrap is complete.
- If not started yet, run `/bonfire start` first, then continue.

## Source

This rule is derived from `AGENTS.md`:

- `Session must begin with /bonfire start before any other work.`
